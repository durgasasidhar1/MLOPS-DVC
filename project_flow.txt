1. create git repo and clone it in local

2. Create a code.py and add code to it (it will save a csv file to a new "data" folder)

3. Do a git add-commit-push before initializing dvc

4. pip install dvc

5. Now we do dvc init (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)

6. Now create folder for storing our data versions mkdir s3 (s3 bucket)

7. Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"

8. Next  "dvc add data/" This command keeps track of our data like git does 
   Now it will ask to do "git rm --cached data" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"
   Because initially we are tracking data folder with git now we are removing from tracking and let dvc to handle it 

9. Again "dvc add data/" creates data.dvc
